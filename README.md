# WebDevHubTestingPage
An HTML/CSS testing page for a university project

This page is using only the HTML and CSS elements and is a web page where students
and the professor can communicate, download exersices and get information about the 
faculty's news.

It is a simple project where I made a use of my HTML and CSS skills.
